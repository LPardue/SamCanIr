# SamCanIr


Simple android app to control Canon DSLR devices

It makes use of an undocumented Samsung IR API, don't expect this to work with anything else but Samsung Galaxy note 10.1 and Samsung Galaxy S4s.

It is extremely buggy, I did not take care of the android development yet.

**Serious**, this is very much of a hack and kind of work in progress!! :)
